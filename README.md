# E-Commerce Back-End
An application that builds the back-end for an e-commerce site using a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Description




### User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

### Acceptance Criteria


```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

### What I Learned
- Further reinforcement of setting up Node.js environments and running a server 
- Linking an API to a database to perform CRUD operations and handle requests on a server
- Using Sequelize methods to build models and create data for our database tables
- Continued use of Insomnia to test API routes for our application
